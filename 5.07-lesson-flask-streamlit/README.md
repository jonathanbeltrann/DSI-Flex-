## Deploy to heroku

1. Install heroku cli.
1. Sign up for a free Heroku account.
1. In a folder not inside a git repo
1. `pip install gunicorn` # server
1. Create a `requirements.txt` file with your pip package versions pinned. `pip freeze > requirements.txt` does this for you, but you will want to delete any extra packages in your environment.
1. Create a _runtime.txt_ file to pin your Python version `python-3.8.7`
1. Create a _Procfile_. This tells Heroku what to do to create your app. `web: gunicorn app:app`
1. Initialize a git repository `git init`
1. Stage changes `git add .`
1. Commit changes `git commit -m 'my_commit_message'`
1. `heroku create`
1. Log in to Heroku with `heroku login`
1. Push your app with `git push heroku master`
1. See your app on the web at your url ðŸŽ‰ (or troubleshoot) with `heroku open`
1. View your app status in your online Heroku dashboard 



## Other Materials

1. [Flask Deployment Options](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/deploying/)
1. [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is perhaps the successor to Flask. It's a similar way to make an API but provides self-documentation and runs faster.
1. [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is another popular web API framework. Flask and FastAPI are lightweight. [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is not.
